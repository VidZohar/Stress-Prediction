# Stress-Prediction
Using Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict Stress

(School project for Optimization in Telecommunications (data structures, algorithms, machine learning) class.)

- Public Dataset WESAD for wearable stress and affect detection. 
- The datased features physiological and motion of 15 subjects. 
- I used Support Vector Macines (linear and non-linear) algorithm and LSTM Neural Nets to predict stress of tested subjects.
